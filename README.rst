js.momentjs
===========

Introduction
------------

This library packages `MomentJS`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`MomentJS`: http://momentjs.com/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.momentjs``) are published to some URL.
